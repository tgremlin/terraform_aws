# Terraform CIDR Subnets Module test cases

This directory is a Terraform configuration that you can apply to verify the
behavior of this module.

It uses
[a third-party provider called `testing`](https://github.com/apparentlymart/terraform-provider-testing) which must be manually installed in one of
Terraform's plugin search directories before running `terraform init`.

With the configuration successfully initialized, run `terraform apply` to see
if it produces any errors. If the apply completes successfully then the tests
have passed.
